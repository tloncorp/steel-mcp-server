Give Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client a real Chrome in the cloud. Read pages that block a plain
`fetch`, fill forms, take screenshots, and hand the browser to a person when a login or a CAPTCHA
needs one. The browser is run by [Steel](https://steel.dev).

**Status:** `3.0.0`. Download it from [Releases](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-mcp-server/releases/latest).
It is not published to npm. `mcp.steel.dev` is not live yet.

## Install

You need a [Steel API key](https://app.steel.dev/settings/api-keys). The free tier is enough to try it.

### Claude for macOS or Windows

Download [`steel-mcp-3.0.0.mcpb`](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-mcp-server/releases/latest)
and open it. Claude installs it and asks for your Steel API key. No Node install is needed.

When you replace an installed bundle, quit and reopen Claude after the installer finishes, then start
a new conversation so Claude reads the new tool catalog.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add steel -e STEEL_API_KEY=your-steel-api-key -- npx -y github:steel-dev/steel-mcp-server
```

The first run clones and builds the server, which takes about a minute. Later runs start at once.

### Cursor, VS Code, and other MCP clients

Add this to the client's MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "steel": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "github:steel-dev/steel-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "STEEL_API_KEY": "<your-steel-api-key>" }
    }
  }
}
```

To run from a checkout instead, `npm install` builds the server; point `command` at `node` and
`args` at `/absolute/path/to/steel-mcp-server/dist/stdio.js`.

### Self-hosted steel-browser

Run the [steel-browser](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-browser) image and set `STEEL_LOCAL=true`
instead of an API key. No key is needed or sent. Self-hosted Steel runs one browser session at a
time per credential, with a durable profile that preserves login state between sessions. It has no
managed proxies, selectable cloud profiles, managed credentials, or CAPTCHA solving; a tool that
asks for one of those gets a named explanation instead.

### A shared endpoint for a team

`dist/hosted.js` serves the same tools over Streamable HTTP, with each caller bringing their own
credential. Claude Code connects to it directly; Claude Desktop needs the `mcp-remote` bridge.
Deployment, Redis, tracing, and the client snippets are in [docs/HOSTING.md](docs/HOSTING.md).

## What you can ask

| Ask | What happens |
|---|---|
| "Read this page and summarize the pricing table." | One `browser_scrape`. No browser session, nothing to release |
| "Compare the price of this product across these three shops." | Three stateless reads, or a session when a shop needs JavaScript to render |
| "Sign in to my account and check last month's invoice." | A session, a snapshot, and the browser handed to you at the login wall. The server never guesses a password |
| "Fill out this application with the details from my CV." | The agent fills the ordinary fields, then `browser_session_handoff` lets you choose the CV locally in the same browser |
| "Screenshot the top of this article for a slide." | One `browser_screenshot`, shown inline when small enough and always linked for download |
| "What happened in my last browser session?" | `browser_session_diagnostics` reads the latest released session. No new browser is started |

## How it works

- **Read first, browse when you must.** `browser_scrape` answers most questions about a page and starts
  no billed session. A session is created only to interact, and released when the task is done.
- **Elements, not pixels.** `browser_snapshot` and `browser_find` read the page as an accessibility tree
  and give targetable elements `@eN` references. `browser_act` clicks, types, and fills by reference.
  Screenshots are for people and for visual checks, never for aiming.
- **Actions report what changed.** A click returns whether the page navigated, the DOM changed, or
  focus moved. If nothing changed, the response says so instead of claiming success. When a
  reference stops working, the error says why and what to call next.
- **People handle the sensitive parts.** On a host with MCP Apps, Claude among them, the running
  browser renders inline in the conversation. **Take control** gives you the browser for a login, a
  CAPTCHA, a payment, or a local file; **Hand back** returns it, and the agent re-reads the page
  before it continues. Login walls and CAPTCHAs trigger the handoff automatically. Saved browser
  profiles and managed credentials are discovered through `browser_session_options`, never guessed.
  Details in [docs/SESSIONS.md](docs/SESSIONS.md).
- **Page content is data, not instructions.** Everything read from a page arrives inside an
  `<untrusted-page-content>` block with hidden text and other prompt-injection carriers stripped.
  Passwords and credentials are redacted before they reach a response or a log.

## Tools

The default `browse` profile exposes sixteen tools. `STEEL_PROFILE=scrape` exposes only the first
three, which never start a browser.

<details>
<summary>The full table</summary>

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `browser_scrape` | Read a budgeted page plus bounded links and metadata. Starts no browser session |
| `browser_screenshot` | Capture a URL for a person, or a live session for a visual check; URL captures support proxies |
| `browser_pdf` | Render a page to PDF and return a link; supports proxies |
| `browser_session_create` | Start a browser session you can interact with |
| `browser_session_release` | Shut it down and stop the meter |
| `browser_login` | Fill a saved login for this bot on the exact HTTPS origin without returning credentials |
| `browser_navigate` | Point a session at a URL |
| `browser_snapshot` | Read the page as an accessibility tree with `@eN` references |
| `browser_find` | Locate elements by text, safe regex, or role without reading the whole page |
| `browser_act` | Click, type, fill a form, select, hover, scroll, press a key, go back, dismiss overlays |
| `browser_wait_for` | Wait for named text, a selector, or a URL |
| `browser_session_diagnostics` | Read a session's activity, or rediscover this credential's live handles, without starting a browser |
| `browser_session_handoff` | Pause while a person takes exclusive control of the same browser, then return it to the agent |
| `browser_session_replay` | On an explicit request, return a finished session's Steel dashboard link |
| `browser_batch` | Run known reversible steps in one call; hands off before login, payment, or final confirmation |
| `browser_session_options` | Plan a non-default session and discover saved profile IDs or managed-login namespaces |
| `browser_session_live_view` | Feeds the inline viewer its connection details. Hosts hide it from the model |

</details>

### Jev browser runs through OpenRouter

Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the **MCP container** to expose `browser_run` and
enable Jev-first instructions for multi-step browsing. No TypeSafe account or
extra browser container is needed. `BROWSER_JEV_MODEL` defaults to
`~typesafe/jev-latest` (including the tilde); set it to pin an OpenRouter Jev model.
The inference key belongs in the operator's secret configuration, not the moon's
MCP upstream headers. The moon's `X-Api-Key` continues to identify its browser tenant.
Without an OpenRouter key, the ordinary browser tools remain available.

Session IDs use randomly chosen `adjective-color-animal` names, such as
`nimble-purple-otter`. The registry checks every candidate against reserved names
and retries collisions. Successful release or expiry cleanup frees the name for
reuse; pending or failed cleanup keeps it reserved. Every request still verifies
the caller's credential: a session name grants no access by itself.

Create a session, navigate to the starting page, then call:

```json
{
  "name": "browser_run",
  "arguments": {
    "session_id": "nimble-purple-otter",
    "task": "Search for espresso and open the matching article",
    "inputs": [{ "field": "Search", "value": "espresso" }],
    "max_steps": 12,
    "max_seconds": 60
  }
}
```

The runner uses the same authenticated session, saved profile, proxy and viewer
as the other browser tools. It neither creates nor closes a browser. Jev chooses
actions from a bounded snapshot; typing uses only supplied non-secret strings
and does not press Enter. Missing inputs, unsupported controls, uncertain decisions,
page changes and confirmation boundaries return control to the main agent on the
same session. Password/OTP forms and challenges stop for human handoff. Ordinary
browser tools handle steps requiring more judgment. Completion is a model judgment;
verify the returned evidence before reporting success.

Each call returns its stop status, action trace, provider-reported usage and final
bounded page evidence when available. Step and time budgets bound the loop; an
already-dispatched browser operation may finish after cancellation, but no new
action is dispatched after the run observes it. Unknown provider responses fail
without executing an action, and provider error bodies are not returned.

Jev runs require **one MCP replica with the in-memory registry**. `REDIS_URL`
together with an inference key is rejected because distributed execution leases
are not configured. In-process session calls are serialized, and each step
rechecks ownership, expiry and human control. The runner charges the tenant's
request budget for each inference call as well as admission.

Page labels and text excerpts, the task and supplied inputs are sent to OpenRouter
and its TypeSafe provider. Existing input values, tenant headers, browser cookies
and viewer capabilities are not included by the runner. Do not supply credentials
or other secrets in tasks or inputs. Page content is untrusted; classification and
label checks are conservative stop conditions, not proof that a website is safe.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `STEEL_API_KEY` | | Required for Steel Cloud. Never sent to a self-hosted deployment |
| `STEEL_LOCAL` | `false` | `true` drives a local steel-browser and waives the API key |
| `STEEL_BASE_URL` | `https://api.steel.dev` | Steel REST base URL. A trailing `/v1` is fine either way |
| `STEEL_PROFILE` | `browse` | `browse` or `scrape` |
| `STEEL_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` | `900000` | Default immutable session lifetime. A create request may choose up to 24 hours, within the account maximum |
| `STEEL_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `600000` | Idle release. Long enough for a handoff, so an abandoned browser can live about 10 minutes |
| `STEEL_MAX_SESSIONS` | `10` | Live sessions plus pending creates per credential; enforced across replicas when using Redis |
| `STEEL_CONNECT_URL` | `wss://connect.steel.dev` | CDP endpoint, derived from the base URL when self-hosted |

Logs are structured JSON on stderr; stdout carries nothing but JSON-RPC. The hosted endpoint has its
own variables, listed in [docs/HOSTING.md](docs/HOSTING.md).

## Troubleshooting

**A site returns 403 or shows a challenge page.** That is bot detection, not a bug. The error names
the vendor and one thing to try next; change one thing at a time. `browser_session_diagnostics` shows
what happened.

**Managed proxies or CAPTCHA solving fail with a payment error.** Those need a $10 verified paid
balance on Launch; free credits do not count.

**A `@eN` reference stopped working.** The error says why: the page navigated, the frame holding it
loaded a new document, the node was removed, or the element changed role or name. It also says what
to call to recover.

**A click reports that nothing changed.** It probably landed on something else. If an overlay covers
the target, the error names it: run `browser_act` with `dismiss_overlays`, then retry. If the target is
inside a frame, the response says the frame is not observed; take a fresh snapshot instead of
clicking again.

**A session seems to have vanished.** Steel releases a session after ten minutes without activity,
and at the plan's hard time limit. Create a new one only if you need to interact again; to read the
old activity, call `browser_session_diagnostics` with its dashboard UUID, or with no id for the latest.

**"Concurrency limit reached" on `browser_session_create`.** Your Steel plan allows fewer simultaneous
browsers than are open. Sessions you forgot to release count; `browser_session_release` frees one
immediately.

**The extension fails to start with a message about `STEEL_API_KEY`.** The key never reached the
server. Open the extension's settings in Claude and enter it again; the field is write-only, so a
blank one looks the same as a filled one.

**Tracing was requested but could not start.** The desktop bundle ships without the OpenTelemetry
exporter stack. The server logs this once and serves normally; a source checkout can install
`@opentelemetry/sdk-node` and `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http`.

## Security and privacy

The server holds no data of its own. It sends the URLs and page interactions a tool call names to
[Steel](https://steel.dev), which runs the browser, and returns what the page said. Page content
passes through to your MCP client. When Jev is configured, `browser_run` also sends
bounded page evidence, its task and explicitly supplied inputs to OpenRouter and
TypeSafe for inference. Password fields and existing field values are excluded
from that evidence. Nothing else about your conversation is
collected, and no telemetry exporter is loaded unless you configure one with a standard `OTEL_*`
variable. Steel's handling of the browser sessions it runs is covered by the
[Steel privacy policy](https://steel.dev/privacy).

Web pages can contain prompt injections, and filtering cannot remove every one. Review browser
actions that submit data, make purchases, or change an account. The threat model and the current
mitigations are in [RESEARCH.md §7](RESEARCH.md#7-security). Report vulnerabilities as described in
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not in a public issue.

## Development

```bash
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test               # unit + integration
npm run budget         # tools/list byte budget per profile
npm run conformance    # MCP conformance suite
npm run test:browser   # runs the inline viewer and the frame snapshot in a real Chrome
npm run test:e2e       # starts, waits for and tears down the real-browser stack
```

[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) has the working rules; this project practises TDD, so a change starts with a
failing test. [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) explains what ships from this one package: the desktop
bundle, the container image, and the hosted service. [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) records what was measured
against Steel's API and Chrome, and [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) the decisions behind the design.

Contributions are welcome: fork, branch, and open a pull request that says what it changes and why.
For bugs, [open an issue](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-mcp-server/issues) with the tool you
called and the error text.

### Planet-backed login vault

Self-hosted operators enable private saved-login filling with `BROWSER_VAULT_ENABLED=true`.
Configuration requires `BROWSER_VAULT_KEY` (base64, 32 random bytes), `BROWSER_VAULT_KEY_ID`,
`BROWSER_VAULT_SERVICE_TOKEN` (at least 32 characters), `PIONEER_SIDECAR_TOKEN`, and `BROWSER_VAULT_PIONEER_ORIGIN`
(an HTTPS origin template containing `{planet}`). The encryption key is durable deployment
state: back it up and keep it consistent across browser clusters in the same environment.
Changing the encryption key requires an explicit re-encryption migration; moon-code and owner-token rotation do not.
Steel authenticates to Pioneer with its existing sidecar token using `Authorization: Basic`.
The viewer service token protects only the private viewer-to-MCP API.

The caller supplies `X-Tlon-Parent-Ship` and `X-Tlon-Ship` as routing hints. Pioneer verifies the
moon's derived browser key before the session can use the vault. Ciphertext lives on the parent
planet, partitioned by bot moon and exact HTTPS origin. Native owner authorization is required
for saving, account selection, listing, and deletion. The model-facing `browser_login` tool
returns status only and fills through the private browser API. It makes at most one automatic
attempt per account revision and form step; a filled result is not proof of sign-in.

The viewer connects to the service-token-protected `/internal/vault/` endpoints. Keep this
surface and the browser REST API private. Both services are disabled by default, and configuration
errors fail startup when enabled. See the sibling Steel Browser Kubernetes deployment guide for
the matching viewer/Pioneer environment, rollout checks, and secret references.
